        Just to get licensing and copyright out of the way: this site is licensed under the <a href="/LICENSE.txt">MIT License</a>, which lets you do whatever you want as long as you keep the license and copyright notice. The only thing I ask is that you don't completely copy me and make money off of it while doing so. (IF you do try that, at least keep the copyright notice.)

        Thank you to all the following people/services:

            <li>To comply with their license, <a href="https://fontawesome.com/license">here's a link to it.</a></li>
            <li>There are also two icons (help-line and envelope) that have been edited to be white instead of black.</li>
            <li>There is also the mutat.io logo, which currently uses the sync-alt icon that's gray instead of black. <i>This is a temporary logo and will change at a later date.</i></li>
          </ul>
          <li><a href="http://w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, for being invaluable sources of information regarding code and for saving my dumb butt more times then I can count.</li>
          <li>The Instagram logo, which provided inspiration for the DSA Bot logo. <i>This was initially from a documentary regarding the change of the logo, but I can't find it anymore. If someone can send it to me, I'll add a link to it here.</i></li>
          <li><a href="https://discord.com/branding">The Discord branding,</a> which provided inspiration for the brand kit.</li>
          <li>Matthais#8217 over the <a href="https://codesupport.dev/">CodeSupport community,</a> for helping out with an odd bug regarding the card's hover functionality.</li>
          <li>My freshman robotics club teacher, who first got me into programming.</li>
          <li>My graphic design teacher, who's helped me with the design aspects in some of my projects, even if it might be outside his comfort zone.</li>
          <li>Everyone who's supported me over the years, either financially, emotionally, or just by sticking around.</li>
          <li>You, for checking this place out and being a really cool person :)</li>
        </ul>
        As cheesy as it sounds, without them none of this wouldn't be possible, so thank you all. Seriously, thank you :D
