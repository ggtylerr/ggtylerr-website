      <p>
        Hello there! Welcome to the first monthly update for my projects. In case this is your first time hearing about me, or my work, I’m a developer and I often make free and open source software. This month, we’re going to be taking a look at KAaNE for qt, along with a few other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t know, KAaNE is the very first project I’ve made as a developer. It’s an assistant tool for the game “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”, and is basically a way to play the game in single player. As it turns out, this is a wonderful first time project, and I’ve often remade it whenever I want to utilize a new language or framework. The original was for Python 2 and getting used to programming, the Java edition was for...well, Java, and was used for basic GUIs, Android was for mobile development, and now, Qt, for C++, proper cross-platform development, and the Qt framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this is a learning experience for me, development is somewhat slow. As you can see, though, there’s already significant progress being made. This is currently using KDDockWidgets, which allows for a much more dynamic layout than in normal programs. There’s still quite a bit to do before an alpha release, like the menu bar, the remaining modules, a README and building instructions, and a way to automatically build using GitHub actions. I’m hoping it’ll be available before the end of September, however, qt can sometimes be very complicated in usually easy areas, even for stuff as simple as an app icon. As for KAaNE on Android, I’m putting my full focus on the first version of the Qt edition, and I’ll start work on it again whenever that version is released.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for other news, I’ve finally got a job! It’s a 4 day per week job, so I’ll still be able to work on projects. That being said, progress will obviously slow down, but on the plus side, I’ll be able to afford an actual hosting server. Yay! This also means I won’t need ko-fi donations, however, if you want to donate, I’ll put that money towards programming, whether that’s for an editor on these videos, another programmer, a paid service, or just something else, you can rest assured that it’ll be put towards that.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, for the part you’re probably most interested about, gg bot. Work is currently halted. Between working a job and making two projects, I simply don’t want to stress myself out. However, I am an actively accepting developers to help on it. If you want to join, please send a message through any of my social media accounts. I prefer contact over email for professional work, however, I respond the quickest over Discord, and you’ll be able to see whenever I’m available. Please have your GitHub profile ready, or just any showcase of your previous work. I’m mainly looking for people with experience in Node.JS, HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It would be recommended you’ve had experience with discord.js and web interfaces, however, it’s not necessary. The only thing I’ll ask of you, if you do decide to join, is that you accept your code will be in an open-source project under the GPL3 license.
      </p>
      <p>
        And...that’s it. If you want updates, I’ll be using this YouTube channel for monthly updates and other videos, so if you want to see them, please subscribe and turn on notifications. That way, you’ll be notified whenever a video is made. I also have a Discord server, where you can chat with other people and choose what kind of updates you want to receive. Thank you for watching, and have a nice day.
