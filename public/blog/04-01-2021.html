      <p>
        Note to self: do reports on the 31st so I don't make a report on the funny haha day
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you don't know why I'm doing this: I recently made a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/ggtylerr">Ko-Fi</a> account and I stated in <a href="https://www.ggtylerr.dev/blog/02-18-2021">a previous post</a> that by the end of every quarter I'd post a transprency report on listing where money earned will go.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far I've earned literally nothing from Ko-Fi (great start) and the amount of money spent so far is $7 ($14 by tomorrow), only for paying repl.it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There <i>is</i>, however, a silver lining - I recently started doing <a href="https://twitch.tv/ggtylerr">streaming on Twitch</a> regularly and had enough of a viewerbase to get Affiliate - and that means I was able to get donations.
      </p>
      <p>
        And from Twitch donations - I was able to get <b>$48.67</b> in total. There's a problem, though - <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/affiliate-payout-faq?language=en_US">you aren't able to payout until you get $100.</a> Plus, I'd rather not mix Twitch donations with Ko-Fi donations. People would want to donate to Twitch streams to support that stream and others would donate to Ko-Fi accounts to support people's creative works. Mixing the two would probably not be the best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now what? We're out of options...right? Well...
      </p>
      <p>
        ...apparently I have connections, and I've gotten gigs to do programming for people for cash. I can't reveal anything regarding these (I prefer to have this kind of stuff anonymous)
      </p>
      <p>
        So, from gigs, I've gotten $22. Not bad, and in total, we have $30 left (after tomorrow) - which means we have until August 2nd until money runs out. Plenty of time to get a part time job and earn money for the server! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, though, I would really appreciate it if we can get donations. With them, not only would I be able to do cooler projects, but I'd also be able to afford food and housing!
      </p>
      <p>
        In all seriousness, though, with donations I'd be able to do some really cool stuff - and there's quite a bit that could be done. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Welp, thank you for reading this stuff. I know reading about apps and services is more boring than actually using them. I <i>am</i> working on everything - just a tad bit more busy than usual due to recent events. See you guys in the next post!
