      <p>
        Welcome to the new site! The blogposts haven't changed, so if this is the first time you're seeing it, you won't notice a thing. If you'd look at the bottom of the screen, though...
      </p>
      <p>
        Woah! There's now icons on them that look a million times better! And if you hover over them, you can still see what they are!
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a ton of other changes as well, so for ease of access (and 'cause I'm lazy), here's a quick list of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"WIP" notice removed from front page</li>
        <li>All other notices removed for the time being (They may come back if needed)</li>
        <li>Footer area replaced with icons and tooltips</li>
        <li>Made footer dynamic to screen size (unless you have an ungodly small screen that's under ~200px wide)</li>
        <li>Added Discord server to footer</li>
        <li>Background added to blog post list</li>
        <li>Weird code style in blog post list fixed</li>
        <li>Projects page completely revamped</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Projects are no longer in two separate pages, now in two separate areas on one page</li>
          <li>All projects now in new 'card' design</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Thank you to Matthais#8217 from the <a href="https://codesupport.dev/">CodeSupport community</a> for helping out with an odd bug with this new design, regarding its hover functionality.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Most project text has been rewritten</li>
          <li>mutat.io added to the released project list since the excuse of it being in alpha doesn't work when 99% of my projects are a WIP</li>
          <li>Meme Dumpyard removed as the source is no longer available (it was also generally terrible anyways)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Socials page now use new 'card' design for accounts</li>
        <li>Added new "Other" page that includes pages that aren't a blog post, project, or social media account.</li>
        <li>Added resume</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Hosted version does not include my phone number or address. (Information can be provided if you can verify you're in a position to both hire developers and not leak it to the world.)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added brand kit</li> <!-- TODO finish up and add files -->
        <li>Added sitemap</li>
        <li>Added credits</li>
        <li>Added Discord embed functionality (which also happens to be basic OpenGraph support) to all pages</li>
        <li>File structure cleaned up</li>
        <li>New favicon, along with proper formats</li>
        <li>Pages no longer link to the favicon by URL</li>
        <li>Additional redirects added to index.js script to reflect new file structure</li>
        <li>Added <a href="/LICENSE.txt">MIT License</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Yeah, I wasn't kidding when I said a "ton". I'm pretty sure this changelog can rival even Minecraft's changelogs. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_1.16.5">In fact, it can.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any feedback on the new site, or just want to pop in and say hello, you should check out <a href="https://discord.gg/A4ccPpKp7b">the Discord server.</a> Yes, I know, shilling again. It's the best way to get in touch with me, though, and I could use some company in there. Seriously, only 11 people are in it. 5 of which are people I know IRL. Plz.
      </p>

        Well, hope you guys enjoy it, and I'll see you all in the next blog post.
